<h3>Smart Repetition</h3>

You can learn a large amount of new foreign words, prepare for the exams and much more. 

The application uses spaced repetitions (spaced repetitions). The clue point is that the information must be repeated at certain increasing intervals. Spaced repetition technique allows all knowledge to be stored in long-term memory, I mean, years from now, youâ€™ll remember the information. At the same time spending less time on memorizing. 

You just need to create cards with words/phrases/sentences. The cards themselves will be shown with an increasing time interval according to the interval repetition algorithm. The app will let you know when the next study will start.
